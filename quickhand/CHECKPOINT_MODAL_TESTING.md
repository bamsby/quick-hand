# Checkpoint Modal with Editable Fields - Testing Guide

## üéØ What Was Implemented

The checkpoint modal now includes **editable input fields** so you can review and modify action parameters before executing them.

### Key Changes

1. **Enhanced Checkpoint Modal** (`lib/ui/checkpoint-modal.tsx`)
   - Added editable TextInput fields for each action
   - Notion actions: Editable "Page Title" field
   - Gmail actions: Editable "Recipients" and "Subject" fields
   - ScrollView support for multiple actions
   - Real-time state updates as you type

2. **Updated Execution Flow** (`app/chat.tsx`)
   - `executeAllActions()` now accepts edited actions from the modal
   - Uses the user-modified parameters instead of defaults

3. **Better Backend Defaults** (`supabase/functions/plan/index.ts`)
   - Notion title: Cleaned-up version of query (removes filler words)
   - Gmail recipient: Empty string (prompts user to fill it)
   - Gmail subject: Auto-generated from query

4. **System Prompts** (`lib/roles.ts`)
   - All roles now know they can save to Notion and draft emails
   - AI won't say "I can't perform actions" anymore

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Backend
```powershell
# If using local Supabase
supabase functions deploy plan

# Or restart local instance
supabase stop
supabase start
```

### Step 2: Restart the App
```powershell
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Multi-Action Query

**Try this query:**
```
Can you find out more about vibe coding, then save into notion and send the note to my email?
```

**Expected Result:**
1. Agent provides information about vibe coding
2. "Proposed Actions" card appears with **"Review Plan"** button
3. Click "Review Plan"

**Checkpoint Modal Should Show:**
- Summary: "QuickHand will save to Notion and draft an email. Proceed?"
- **Action 1: Save to Notion**
  - ‚úèÔ∏è Editable field: "Page Title" (pre-filled with cleaned query)
- **Action 2: Draft Email**
  - ‚úèÔ∏è Editable field: "Recipients" (empty, waiting for your input)
  - ‚úèÔ∏è Editable field: "Subject" (pre-filled)

### Step 4: Edit and Execute

1. **Edit the Page Title** (e.g., "Vibe Coding Research")
2. **Enter your email** in Recipients field (e.g., "john@example.com")
3. **Optionally edit the subject**
4. Click **[Run All]**

**Expected Behavior:**
- Modal closes
- Both actions execute sequentially with **your edited values**
- See real-time status badges (running ‚Üí done/error)
- Toast notification: "2 actions completed!"
- Individual action buttons appear with links to open results

---

## üìã Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Single Action (No Checkpoint)
**Query:** "Save this conversation to Notion"

**Expected:**
- Only 1 action detected ‚Üí Shows individual "Save to Notion" button directly
- No checkpoint modal
- Clicking button shows the existing Notion confirmation modal

---

### Test Case 2: Multiple Actions (With Checkpoint)
**Query:** "Research React hooks, save to Notion and draft an email"

**Expected:**
- 2 actions detected ‚Üí Shows "Review Plan" button
- Checkpoint modal with editable fields for both actions
- Can edit both before executing

---

### Test Case 3: Cancel from Checkpoint
**Query:** "Save to Notion and email me"

**Expected:**
- Click "Review Plan" ‚Üí Modal opens
- Click **[Cancel]** ‚Üí Modal closes
- Individual action buttons appear (can execute them separately)
- Each individual action still shows its confirmation modal

---

### Test Case 4: Empty Email Field Warning
**Query:** "Save to Notion and email me"

**Steps:**
1. Click "Review Plan"
2. Fill Notion title
3. Leave email Recipients field **empty**
4. Click **[Run All]**

**Expected:**
- Gmail action uses fallback: "your.email@example.com"
- Consider adding validation to prevent empty email (optional future enhancement)

---

## üé® UI Features to Verify

### Checkpoint Modal Layout
- ‚úÖ Summary text at top
- ‚úÖ Each action in separate card with number
- ‚úÖ Input fields are clearly labeled
- ‚úÖ Text inputs respond to keyboard input
- ‚úÖ Modal is scrollable for many actions
- ‚úÖ [Cancel] button (gray) and [Run All] button (green)

### Keyboard Behavior
- ‚úÖ Email field shows email keyboard (@ symbol visible)
- ‚úÖ All fields support text input
- ‚úÖ Modal doesn't close when typing

---

## üêõ Known Limitations (Future Enhancements)

1. **No validation on empty email** - Currently uses fallback
2. **Content preview** - Body content not shown in checkpoint (only title/subject)
3. **Action-specific icons** - Could add visual icons for Notion/Gmail

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The checkpoint modal is working correctly if:

1. Multi-action plans show "Review Plan" button
2. Checkpoint modal displays with editable fields
3. You can type in the fields and values persist
4. Clicking "Run All" executes actions with your edited values
5. Actions execute sequentially with real-time status updates
6. No more "I can't perform actions" messages from AI
7. Single actions skip checkpoint (existing behavior preserved)

## üöÄ Quick Demo Flow

**User:** "Research TypeScript decorators, save to Notion as 'TS Decorators', and email to team@example.com"

**Agent:** [Provides research + 2 actions]

**User:** Clicks "Review Plan"

**Modal Shows:**
```
QuickHand will save to Notion and draft an email. Proceed?

1. Save to Notion
   Page Title: [TS Decorators] ‚úèÔ∏è

2. Draft Email
   Recipients: [team@example.com] ‚úèÔ∏è
   Subject: [Re: Research TypeScript decorators...] ‚úèÔ∏è

[Cancel] [Run All]
```

**User:** Clicks "Run All"

**Result:** 
- Both actions execute with exact values from modal
- Toast: "2 actions completed!"
