# Search Bias Fix - Removing Context Pollution

## üêõ Issue

**Query:** "Research about AI agents and save to Notion"

**Bad Response (Before Fix):**
```
AI agents, particularly in the context of Notion, are designed to 
enhance productivity...

Notion's new AI functionalities allow users to create agents...
```

**Problem:** The search results and AI response were biased toward Notion-specific content, even though the user just wanted general information about AI agents. The action phrase "save to Notion" was polluting the search query.

---

## üîç Root Cause

### The Search Pollution Chain:

1. **Full Query Used for Search:**
   - Query: "Research about AI agents **and save to Notion**"
   - Exa search received: "Research about AI agents **and save to Notion**"
   - Search results: Biased toward Notion-related AI agents

2. **Biased Sources:**
   - Exa returned sources about "Notion AI agents" instead of general AI agents
   - LLM summarized from these biased sources
   - Result: Response incorrectly focused on Notion context

3. **Flow:**
   ```
   User Query ‚Üí Exa Search (with action phrases) ‚Üí Biased Sources ‚Üí Biased Response
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Use Cleaned Topic for Search

Extract the main topic **BEFORE** searching, then use the cleaned topic for the Exa API call:

```typescript
// BEFORE (v6): Used full query for search
citations = await searchExa(userQuery, exaApiKey, citationLimit);
// Query: "Research about AI agents and save to Notion"
// ‚ùå Results biased toward Notion

// AFTER (v7): Extract topic first, then search
const mainTopic = extractMainTopic(userQuery);
// mainTopic: "Research about AI agents"
console.log(`Cleaned search topic: "${mainTopic}"`);

citations = await searchExa(mainTopic, exaApiKey, citationLimit);
// ‚úÖ Results are general AI agents, not Notion-specific
```

### Flow Diagram:

```
User Query: "Research about AI agents and save to Notion"
     ‚Üì
extractMainTopic() ‚Üí "Research about AI agents"
     ‚Üì
Exa Search with cleaned topic ‚Üí General AI agent sources
     ‚Üì
LLM summarizes from general sources ‚Üí Unbiased response
     ‚Üì
Action detection (separate) ‚Üí "Save to Notion" button
```

---

## üìä Impact

### Before Fix (v6):
- ‚ùå Search query: "Research about AI agents **and save to Notion**"
- ‚ùå Results: Notion-specific AI agent content
- ‚ùå Response: "AI agents in the context of Notion..."
- ‚ùå User gets wrong information

### After Fix (v7):
- ‚úÖ Search query: "Research about AI agents" (cleaned)
- ‚úÖ Results: General AI agent content from diverse sources
- ‚úÖ Response: General AI agent information
- ‚úÖ User gets accurate, unbiased research
- ‚úÖ "Save to Notion" button still works (action detection is separate)

---

## üéØ Expected Results (After Fix)

**Query:** "Research about AI agents and save to Notion"

**Good Response (After Fix):**
```
AI agents are autonomous software systems that can perform tasks 
and make decisions based on their environment [1]. They operate 
using various AI techniques including machine learning, natural 
language processing, and reasoning systems [2].

Key capabilities include:
- Autonomous task execution [1]
- Adaptive learning from experience [2]
- Multi-domain application [3]
```

**Then:** "Save to Notion" button appears

---

## üîß Implementation Details

### Changes in `supabase/functions/plan/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Check if web search is needed
if (exaApiKey && needsWebSearch(userQuery)) {
  console.log("Performing web search for:", userQuery);
  const citationLimit = getCitationLimit(userQuery);
  console.log(`Citation limit for this query: ${citationLimit}`);
  
  // Extract main topic BEFORE searching to avoid biased results
  const mainTopic = extractMainTopic(userQuery);
  console.log(`Cleaned search topic: "${mainTopic}"`);
  
  // Use cleaned topic for search to avoid context bias
  citations = await searchExa(mainTopic, exaApiKey, citationLimit);
  
  if (citations.length > 0) {
    contextPrompt = "\n\nWEB SEARCH RESULTS:\n" +
      citations.map(c => 
        `[${c.id}] ${c.title}\n${c.snippet}\nURL: ${c.url}`
      ).join("\n\n") +
      `\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n` +
      `User wants to know about: "${mainTopic}"\n` +
      `1. Use ONLY the above sources to provide information about this topic\n` +
      `2. Provide a clear, informative summary based on the sources\n` +
      `3. Include inline citations like [1], [2] to reference specific information\n` +
      `4. Be concise and accurate\n` +
      `5. Do NOT give instructions on how to save/email - just provide the information itself\n` +
      `6. Do NOT add context or assumptions beyond what's in the sources (e.g., don't focus on Notion/email if that's not the topic)\n` +
      `7. The user's actions (save to Notion, draft email, etc.) will be handled automatically with action buttons`;
  }
}
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Extract before searching** - Clean the query first
2. **Use cleaned topic** - Pass only the core research question to Exa
3. **Log cleaned topic** - Console log helps with debugging
4. **Additional instruction** - Added instruction #6 to prevent context assumptions

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Test 1: General Research + Action

**Query:** "Research about AI agents and save to Notion"

**Expected:**
- Search query to Exa: "Research about AI agents"
- Sources: General AI agent information
- Response: Unbiased AI agent summary
- Action: "Save to Notion" button

### Test 2: Email Draft + Research

**Query:** "Find information about climate change and draft email"

**Expected:**
- Search query to Exa: "Find information about climate change"
- Sources: General climate change content
- Response: Climate change information (not email-focused)
- Action: "Draft Email" button

### Test 3: Multiple Actions

**Query:** "Research machine learning and save to Notion and email"

**Expected:**
- Search query to Exa: "Research machine learning"
- Sources: General ML content
- Response: ML information
- Actions: Both "Save to Notion" and "Draft Email" buttons

---

## üìù Files Modified

1. **`supabase/functions/plan/index.ts`**
   - Moved `extractMainTopic()` call before search
   - Changed `searchExa()` to use `mainTopic` instead of `userQuery`
   - Added console log for cleaned search topic
   - Added instruction #6 to prevent context assumptions
   - Deployed as **version 7**

---

## üéì Key Learning

### Problem: Context Pollution in Search

When users combine information queries with action requests:
```
"Research about X and [action]"
```

The action phrase can pollute the search query and bias results.

### Solution: Separate Concerns

1. **Content Query:** Clean and use for search ‚Üí Unbiased results
2. **Action Detection:** Detect separately ‚Üí Proper action buttons

### Principle: Clean Input, Separate Concerns

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Mixed concerns
searchExa("Research about AI agents and save to Notion")

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Separated concerns
const topic = extractMainTopic(query);        // "Research about AI agents"
const results = searchExa(topic);             // Unbiased search
const action = detectAction(query);            // "Save to Notion"
```

This is a fundamental software engineering principle: **Separation of Concerns**

After this fix, the following should be true:

1. ‚úÖ Query "Research about AI agents and save to Notion"
   - Returns general AI agent information
   - NOT Notion-specific content

2. ‚úÖ Search is unbiased by action phrases
   - "save to Notion" doesn't bias search
   - "draft email" doesn't bias search

3. ‚úÖ Actions still work correctly
   - "Save to Notion" button appears
   - Citations are included
   - Auto-generated title works

4. ‚úÖ Separation of concerns maintained
   - Content generation is independent
