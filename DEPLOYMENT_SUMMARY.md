## ✅ Successfully Deployed

### Edge Functions Deployed via Supabase MCP

Both edge functions have been **successfully deployed** to Supabase using MCP tools:

1. **`plan`** - Version 4 (ACTIVE)
   - Added smart citation limiting (1, 3, or 5 based on query complexity)
   - Added auto-title generation using OpenAI
   - Citations now passed to Notion actions

2. **`notion-create-page`** - Version 3 (ACTIVE)
   - Citations parameter support
   - Bold text formatting for citation titles
   - Sources section automatically appended to content

### Cursor Rules Updated

The `.cursorrules` file has been updated with a new **Supabase MCP Integration** section:

- **Critical Rule:** ALWAYS use Supabase MCP tools for database and edge function operations
- Lists all available MCP tools with descriptions
- Provides examples and best practices
- Added to "When Generating Code" section as mandatory practice

## Features Now Live

### 1. ✅ Auto-Generated Titles
- Titles are automatically generated by OpenAI based on content
- Users can still edit titles in the confirmation modal
- Max 60 characters, concise and descriptive

### 2. ✅ Citations in Notion
- All web search citations are appended to Notion pages
- Appear in a "Sources" section with:
  - Citation number (e.g., [1], [2])
  - **Bold** title
  - URL link

### 3. ✅ Smart Citation Limiting
- **Simple queries** → 1 citation (e.g., "what is X")
- **Most queries** → 3 citations (default)
- **Complex queries** → 5 citations (e.g., "compare X vs Y")

## Deployment Method

Used **Supabase MCP** instead of terminal commands:
```typescript
// ✅ Deployed using:
mcp_supabase_deploy_edge_function({
  name: "plan",
  entrypoint_path: "index.ts",
  files: [{ name: "index.ts", content: "..." }]
})

// ❌ NOT using:
// npx supabase functions deploy plan
```

## Benefits of Using MCP

1. **No authentication issues** - MCP handles auth automatically
2. **Works in non-TTY environments** - No terminal interaction needed
3. **Programmatic deployment** - Can be automated
4. **Consistent** - Same method for all Supabase operations
5. **Fast** - Direct API calls without CLI overhead

## Verification

All edge functions confirmed ACTIVE:
- ✅ `plan` (v4)
- ✅ `notion-create-page` (v3)
- ✅ `notion-auth-status` (v2)
- ✅ `notion-oauth-callback` (v2)

## Testing the Feature

Try these queries in the app:

1. **Simple:** "What is OpenAI? Save to Notion"
   - Expected: 1 citation, auto-generated title

2. **General:** "Tell me about AI hackathons and save"
   - Expected: 3 citations, auto-generated title

3. **Complex:** "Compare GPT-4 vs Claude and save to Notion"
   - Expected: 5 citations, auto-generated title

Check the created Notion page for:
- ✅ Auto-generated title
- ✅ Main content with inline citations [1], [2]
- ✅ "Sources" section at the end with bold titles and URLs

## Next Steps

Going forward, ALWAYS use Supabase MCP for:
- Deploying edge functions
- Running SQL queries
- Applying migrations
- Checking logs
- Managing branches

The cursor rules have been updated to enforce this practice.
