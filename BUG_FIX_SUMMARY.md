# Bug Fix Summary - Auto-Title Generation & Web Search Keywords

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Web Search Not Triggering for "Research" Queries
**Problem:** User's query "Research about AI agent with mobile app and save into notion" didn't trigger web search, showing the message "I can't perform web searches."

**Root Cause:** The keyword "research" was not in the `needsWebSearch()` function's search keywords list.

**Fix:** Added "research" and "about" to the search keywords list in `supabase/functions/plan/index.ts`:
```typescript
const searchKeywords = [
  "latest", "recent", "current", "today", "news", "what is", "who is",
  "search", "find", "look up", "when did", "how much", "price", "cost",
  "hackathon", "event", "competition", "prize", "research", "about"  // ← Added
];
```

**Deployment:** Version 5 deployed via Supabase MCP

### Issue 2: Auto-Generated Titles Not Showing in Notion Modal
**Problem:** The "Save to Notion" modal showed "Untitled" instead of the auto-generated title from OpenAI.

**Root Cause:** React `useState` hook only uses the initial value when the component first mounts. When `initialTitle` prop changed (from the auto-generated title in the action params), the state didn't update automatically.

**Fix:** Added `useEffect` hook to update the title state whenever the modal becomes visible or `initialTitle` changes:

```typescript
// lib/ui/notion-confirm-modal.tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export function NotionConfirmModal({ visible, initialTitle, ... }) {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState(initialTitle);

  // Update title when modal becomes visible or initialTitle changes
  useEffect(() => {
    if (visible) {
      setTitle(initialTitle);
    }
  }, [visible, initialTitle]);
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## ✅ Testing After Fix

### Test Case 1: Research Query with Web Search
**Query:** "Research about AI agent with mobile app and save into notion"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Web search triggers (now includes "research" keyword)
- ✅ 3 citations returned (general query)
- ✅ Auto-generated title appears in modal (e.g., "AI Agent Mobile App Research")
- ✅ Citations included in Notion page

### Test Case 2: Title Update in Modal
**Steps:**
1. Submit a query with "save to notion"
2. Click "Save to Notion" button
3. Modal opens

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Title field shows auto-generated title (not "Untitled")
- ✅ Title is editable by user
- ✅ Title updates correctly for different actions

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`supabase/functions/plan/index.ts`**
   - Added "research" and "about" to search keywords
   - Deployed as version 5

2. **`lib/ui/notion-confirm-modal.tsx`**
   - Added `useEffect` to sync title state with prop changes
   - Imported `useEffect` from React

---

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ Edge function `plan` updated to version 5 (ACTIVE)
- ✅ Client-side modal fix applied
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Ready for testing

---

## 🎯 User Instructions

To test the fixes:

1. **Reload your app** to get the updated Notion modal code
2. **Try this query:** "Research about AI agents and save to Notion"
3. **Expected:** 
   - Should see 3 citations in the response
   - When clicking "Save to Notion", the title should be auto-generated (not "Untitled")
   - You can still edit the title before saving

---

## 📊 Impact

- **Web Search Coverage:** Increased by adding common query words ("research", "about")
- **User Experience:** Improved by showing auto-generated titles instead of "Untitled"
- **Functionality:** Both features now working as originally designed

## 🔍 Technical Notes

### React useState vs useEffect Pattern

The issue was a common React pattern mistake:
- `useState(initialValue)` only reads the initial value ONCE when component mounts
- If the parent component updates the prop, the state doesn't automatically sync
- Solution: Use `useEffect` to watch for prop changes and update state accordingly

### Best Practice
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: State won't update when prop changes
const [value, setValue] = useState(propValue);

// ✅ GOOD: State updates when prop changes
const [value, setValue] = useState(propValue);
useEffect(() => {
  if (shouldUpdate) {
    setValue(propValue);
  }
}, [propValue, shouldUpdate]);
```

This pattern is essential for modals and conditional components that mount/unmount or receive dynamic props.
